I am a highly motivated and results driven economist who has an education in theoretical and empirical economics with invaluable experience in research and financial risk management. I hold a PhD degree in Law & Economics from the University of Turin.

My expertise is in the area of banking and financial regulations with a particular focus on model risk management and model validation. I am skilled in credit risk model development, validation, audit and methodology design under various regulations including ECB Guidelines, Basel II and IFRS9. I have experience in leading end to end development of complex model risk solutions.
